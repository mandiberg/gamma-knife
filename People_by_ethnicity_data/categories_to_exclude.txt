These are the categories to be excluded. They fall into several categories:

- People from or employed in a place; they will be cross categorized if this corresponds to nationality or ethnicity. United_States_ is all military personel. 
- People who emigrated from settler colonial countries
- Fictional people
- Non biographical categories
- Athletes from a place

Categories I left in, which are questionable:

- Politicians. Too many to try to remove. Too many variations. Heads of state, ministers, by country, etc. 

- _players - can't remove, because it has multiple meanings. But what that means is that there are many sportspeople who are included simply because they played on a specific team.
